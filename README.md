<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Medicare Data Fraud Detection project is a key
undertaking that uses machine learning-based methods to
identify and stop fraudulent medical claims in the Medicare
system. Millions of Americans, including those over 65
and with disabilities, are covered by the Medicare program
for health insurance. Unfortunately, there are a number
of fraudulent practices that can be committed against the
Medicare system, including filing false claims, overcharging,
and paying for needless medical treatments. Such fraudulent
acts have the potential to cause considerable losses in public
funds and have an impact on the caliber of the recipientsâ€™
medical care.<br>
Both rule-based systems and machine learning-based
techniques are now used in research on Medicare fraud
detection. While machine learning-based approaches employ
historical data to find trends and anomalies, rule-based
systems rely on predetermined rules to identify suspicious
activity. To find fraudulent actions in the Medicare system,
the Medicare Data Fraud Detection project makes use of
machine learning-based methods.<br>
The goal of this research is to create a classification
model based on machine learning that can accurately identify
false medical claims in the Medicare system. LinearSVC,
Naive Bayes, decision trees, and random forests
are just a few of the machine learning algorithms used in
the research, which makes use of three data sets, including
Medicare claims data</p>
